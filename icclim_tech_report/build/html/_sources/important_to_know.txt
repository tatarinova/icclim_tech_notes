Important to know
===============================
Here is an overview of some important points concerning the *ICCLIM* library.

1. Input files must be compliant to the `CF convention <http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/>`_.
2. Currently, *ICCLIM* doesn't support spatial subsetting, i.e. it processes whole spatial area.
3. *ICCLIM* works with unsecured OPeNDAP datasets as well.
